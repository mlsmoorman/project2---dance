# So you think you can...JUDGE?

So you think you can...JUDGE? is a fan app where you can practice skills of judging performances that are viewed throughout the dance team season.  New performances can be entered at any time and anyone can go in and add their scores of those performances.  The user that added a performance can go in and update that performance.  A user that adds a score has the option to also delete that score.
