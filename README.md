# So you think you can...JUDGE?

So you think you can...JUDGE? is a fan app where you can practice skills of judging performances that are viewed throughout the dance team season.  New performances can be entered at any time and anyone can go in and add their scores of those performances.  The user that added a performance can go in and update that performance.  A user that adds a score has the option to also delete that score.

# Future Enhancements

- If videos are available on YouTube - create links to the performance so those that may have missed it live, can still add scores and comments
- Create a JAM section for the app that allows officials access to enter scores during competitions
    - Give specific access to JAM Judges to enter official scores
    - Give specific access to JAM Superior Judges to update / remove scores, if needed
